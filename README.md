# GNN_std_cell

This program is a that collects valid data from raw data generated by a RL program which automaticlly optimize PDP(Power Delay Product) of flexible standard cells based on a compact model(Athor: Leilai Shao)

data_processing.py and a blank file "all.txt" should be used in the raw data directory which is not included here since is is too large

"Std_cell_name.txt" files are for data_processing.py to transforming  each valid standard cell data into a graph

Dataset_gen.py is for building GCN dataset which contains the transformed graph data

train_test_GCN.py is training and testing program for GCN

Up to now, the accuracy of prediction whether a certain set of parameters [VDD, mu, Vth, SS, Cox, RCS, RCD] can successfully generate a standard cell with normal logic function is 77%
