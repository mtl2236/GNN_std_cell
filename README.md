# GNN_std_cell

This program is a that collects valid data from raw data generated by a RL program which automaticlly optimize PDP(Power Delay Product) of flexible standard cells based on a compact model(Athor: Leilai Shao)

data_processing.py and a blank file "all.txt" should be used in the raw data directory which is not included here since is is too large

By running data_processing.py, we can get a rewrited "all.txt" which contains the graph information from raw data. Then we mannually add some structural code into "all.txt "and rename it as "Dataset_gen.py"  

"Std_cell_name.txt" files are for data_processing.py to transforming  each valid standard cell data into a graph

train_test_GCN.py is training and testing program for GCN

Up to now, the accuracy of prediction whether a certain set of parameters [VDD, mu, Vth, SS, Cox, RCS, RCD] can successfully generate a standard cell with normal logic function is 97%. For those cells who have normal logic function, the accuracy of power-delay-product(PDP) is up to 0.96 R2 score. 

The graph input feature is defined as [Type Voltage Polar Mu Cox Vth SS Rcs Rcd]
